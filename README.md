# Run For This

One of the most cited reasons for problematics politics in the US is that good people won't run for office. Often, they don't even know what they can run for.
Run For This is an app intended to lower the barrier between people and entertaining the thought of running for office.
All a user has to do is input their address and Run For This will show them their local offices that are opening up for election.

Minimum Viable Product:
  A user can input their address and RFT will show them a list of legislative offices opening up in the next year.
